I cannot execute the code myself, but I can generate the Python script for you. Here is the script:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample data for opportunities
data = {
    "Opportunity": ["Product A", "Product B", "Product C", "Product D"],
    "Revenue Potential ($)": [500000, 300000, 700000, 200000],
    "Cost ($)": [200000, 150000, 250000, 100000],
    "Probability of Success (%)": [80, 60, 90, 50]
}

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate Expected Value (EV) for each opportunity
df["Expected Value ($)"] = (df["Revenue Potential ($)"] - df["Cost ($)"]) * (df["Probability of Success (%)"] / 100)

# Sort opportunities by Expected Value in descending order
df = df.sort_values(by="Expected Value ($)", ascending=False)

# Display the most financially valuable opportunities
print("Most Financially Valuable Opportunities:")
print(df)
```

You can execute this script in a Python environment to verify its functionality. Let me know if you need further assistance!
