It seems there are persistent issues with executing the code in this environment. However, you can run the following Python script on your local machine to calculate prime numbers up to 500:

```python
def calculate_primes(limit):
    primes = []
    for num in range(2, limit + 1):
        is_prime = True
        for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
            if num % i == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            primes.append(num)
    return primes

# Calculate prime numbers up to 500
prime_numbers = calculate_primes(500)
print(prime_numbers)
```

This script will output all prime numbers up to 500. Let me know if you need further help!
