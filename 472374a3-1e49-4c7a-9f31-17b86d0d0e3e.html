I cannot execute the code directly, but I can generate the Python script for you. Here is the Python script:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample data representing opportunities
data = {
    "Opportunity": ["Project A", "Project B", "Project C", "Project D"],
    "Investment Cost": [100000, 200000, 150000, 300000],
    "Expected Revenue": [300000, 500000, 400000, 600000],
    "Risk Factor": [0.2, 0.3, 0.1, 0.4]  # Lower is better
}

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate financial value score (simplified formula: revenue - cost - risk adjustment)
df["Financial Value"] = df["Expected Revenue"] - df["Investment Cost"] - (df["Risk Factor"] * df["Expected Revenue"])

# Sort opportunities by financial value in descending order
df = df.sort_values(by="Financial Value", ascending=False)

# Display the most financially valuable opportunities
print("Most Financially Valuable Opportunities:")
print(df[["Opportunity", "Financial Value"]])
```

You can execute this script in your Python environment to verify its functionality. Let me know if you need further assistance!
