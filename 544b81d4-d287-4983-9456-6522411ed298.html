Review for improvements:
1. **Code Structure**: The code is clean and well-structured. It defines a `Node` class for individual elements and a `LinkedList` class for managing the list.
2. **Functionality**: The `reverse` method correctly reverses the linked list by iterating through the nodes and adjusting the `next` pointers.
3. **Edge Cases**: The code handles edge cases like an empty list or a list with a single node without issues.
4. **Efficiency**: The reversal is done in O(n) time complexity, which is optimal for this operation.
5. **Enhancements**: 
   - Add type hints for better readability and maintainability.
   - Include a method to check if the list is empty.
   - Add comments to explain the logic in the `reverse` method for clarity.
   - Consider adding unit tests to verify the functionality of the reversal method.
