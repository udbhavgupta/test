```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def append(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = new_node
            return
        current = self.head
        while current.next:
            current = current.next
        current.next = new_node

    def print_list(self):
        current = self.head
        while current:
            print(current.data, end=" -> ")
            current = current.next
        print("None")

    def reverse(self):
        prev = None
        current = self.head
        while current:
            next_node = current.next
            current.next = prev
            prev = current
            current = next_node
        self.head = prev
```

Review for improvements:
1. The code is functional and correctly reverses a linked list.
2. The `reverse` method is efficient and uses an iterative approach, which is optimal for reversing a linked list.
3. The `print_list` method provides a clear way to visualize the linked list before and after reversal.
4. The code is clean and adheres to Python conventions.

No improvements are necessary as the code is already optimal and functional.
